# An example of content for a web page that could be generated  for each ingested source automatically from yaml content in RIGs and Infores catalogs, to replace the current "Source Wiki" system. 
# Content of this page is selected to be useful for end users navigating to it from an edge in the UI that was provided by the source. 
# It includes terms of use info, and a list of edge types provided by the source with an explanation for why each was created. 
# The web page format of this content would resemble that of the RIG pages from which this subset of content is derived. e.g. [here](https://biolink.github.io/resource-ingest-guide-schema/diseases_rig/).

description: >-
      CTD is a robust, publicly available database that aims to advance understanding
      about how environmental exposures affect human health. It provides knowledge,
      manually curated from the literature, about chemicals and their relationship to
      other biological entities: chemical to gene/protein interactions plus chemical to
      disease and gene to disease relationships. These data are integrated with functional
      and pathway data to aid in the development of hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying
      environmentally influenced diseases.

ingested_edge_types:
  - subject_categories:
        - biolink:ChemicalEntity
    predicate:  biolink:treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat

    ui_explanation: CTD Chemical-Disease records with a "T" (therapeutic) DirectEvidence code indicate the chemical to be a "potential" treatment in virtue of its clinical use or study - which maps best to the Biolink predicate 'treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat'.
    additional_notes: The 'treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat' predicate is used to avoid making too strong a claim, as CTDs definition of its "T" flag is broad ("a chemical that has a known or potential therapeutic role in a disease"), which covered cases where a chemical may formally treat a disease or only have been studied or applied to treat a disease. All edges are manual agent knowledge assertions, as the ingested data is based on manual literature curation.

    agent_type:
      - manual_agent
    edge_properties:
      - publications
    ui_explanation: CTD Chemical-Disease records with a DirectEvidence code of "M" (marker/mechanism) indicate that the chemical is manually flagged as a marker or contributing factor for a condition. This implies that at minimum there is correlation between the presence of the chemical and condition, for which we use the Biolink 'correlated_with' predicate.

    predicate:  biolink:associated_with

    agent_type:
      - data_analysis_pipeline
    edge_properties:
      - publications
      - has_confidence_score
    ui_explanation: CTD Chemical-Disease records with an inference score have a statistically significant number of shared gene associations that suggest a biological relationship may exist. The statistical basis of this general inferred relationship is best reported using the Biolink 'associated_with' predicate.

translator_terms_of_use: Translator integrates knowledge from numerous public sources. Any re-use of data should adhere to terms of use defined by its source, as described above.
