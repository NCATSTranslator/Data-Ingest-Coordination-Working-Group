# *D*ata *ING*est *O*perations ("DINGO") Working Group

This Working Group is focused on coordinating the ingestion of data into a centralized Translator Knowledge Graph "data layer." 
The group is responsible for developing and maintaining the Translator Data Ingestion Plan, which includes the development of a Data 
Ingestion Catalog, and the coordination of data ingestion activities across the Consortium. The group will 
also work to develop and maintain a Data Ingestion SOP, and will coordinate with the Standards, Planning, User Interface Team, and Engineering 
Committees to ensure that data ingestion activities are aligned with the goals of the Translator Consortium.

## Weekly meetings on Tuesdays, 3 pm ET, 12pm PT.
